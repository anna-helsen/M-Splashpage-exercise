    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>I'm Anna and this is my test HTML!</p>
    <p class="special">I'm curently learning things needed to get into Frontend Development, a topic that's interested me since Middle School many -many- years ago.</p> 
    <p>Currently I work as a Media Artist, where I get to play around with Arduinos, Motors, Sound Art, cables, piezo mics, circuits for circuitry based sound and more!</p>

    <p>I'm one of the organizers of the Energy devroom at FOSDEM, and worked in community management in the past.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for someone to collaborate on projects where I could practice my coding skills, or just fun media art projects, do please let me know!</p>
